# Friends-App
This project is one of my hometasks for <a href='https://github.com/kottans'>Kottans</a> frontend <a href='https://github.com/Kottans/frontend'>course</a>.</br>
I've learned how to get and work with data from the api, here I'm using <a href='https://randomuser.me/'>Randomuser api</a>.</br> The filter and sorting methods were implemented in the project.
I've used a lot of ES6 features, such as arrow functions, promises, destructuring, template strings.</br>
With this app you can filter friends by gender, sort and search by name.</br>
It is adaptive for mobile devices.</br>
See how it works here:</br>
